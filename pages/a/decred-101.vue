              <h2>Decred is Sound Money</h2>
              <p>
                In current times, traditional paper money or "fiat money" (dollars, euros, etc.)
                is controlled by banks, which create new money as credit. The money supply is
				controlled to target specific economic conditions, usually including a degree of inflation in prices.
				This inflation means that everyone who is not benefitting directly from the creation of the new money is losing out.
              </p>

              <p>
                With the Internet, people can easily form networks and produce resources or deliver services together.
				With Bitcoin we discovered a way to maintain a distributed ledger for recording transactions, without relying on any specific (centralized) authority to enforce the rules.
				By gamifying the process for adding new transactions to this "blockchain", and making this role "permissionless" (anyone with the hardware can do it) the network's miners and nodes can
                effectively ensure that everyone follows the rules - as long as
                most of the entities which participate in creating the
                blockchain are honest.
              </p>

              <p>
                Decred is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, but
                with a strong focus on community input, open governance and
                sustainable funding for development. It is money designed to be
                predictable and scarce. Nobody has the power to print DCR out of
                thin air and there will never be more than 21 million DCR.

                  Free speech and consideration: Everyone has the right to
                  communicate opinions and ideas without fear of censorship.
                  Consideration shall be given to all constructive speech that
                  is based in fact and reason.

              <h2>Decred is secure</h2>
              <p>
                Network security is the foundation to any financial system.
                Agreement on transactions and account balances, also known as
                consensus, is vital to confidence in the currency and can be
                measured by both longevity and analysis of its resistance to
                various attack vectors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Decred uses a hybrid system:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining system as Bitcoin has</li>
                <li>
                  a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system to validate blocks produced by
                  PoW miners
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                PoS ensures that a small group of miners cannot dominate the
                flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the
                approval of the Decred stakeholders community.
              </p>

              <p>
                Decred employs a combination of PoW and PoS to yield the best of
                both systems, mitigate their weaknesses, and deliver a layered
                consensus mechanism that makes it far more secure than other
                cryptocurrencies.
              </p>

              <BlockHint icon="c-scale-to-original">
                Decred uses conventional PoW with a BLAKE-256 hash algorithm,
                and it is mined exclusively by ASICs.

              <p>
                Decred stakeholders lock their funds for a certain time to
                purchase tickets in a "lottery". These tickets are added to a
                pool of roughly 41,000 tickets. Five tickets are pseudorandomly
                selected to validate the Proof-of-Work transactions from a
                previously mined block. If at least 3 of 5 of the chosen tickets
                approve the block from the miner, the minerâ€™s reward is approved
                and the block is added to the blockchain.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, if the mined block is rejected by the PoS system, the
                block is rejected and a new block has to be mined. This prevents
                miners from misbehaving as they would waste precious electricity
                and hardware resources if they continue to produce malicious
                blocks.
